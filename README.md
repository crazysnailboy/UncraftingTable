# jglrxavpok's Uncrafting Table

### A mod for Minecraft 1.9.4

This mod adds an Uncrafting Table which allows you to convert unwanted items back into the resources they're crafted from, in exchange for XP.

Original mod by jglrxavpok, updated for Minecraft 1.7.10 by Jordy141. I fixed a couple of bugs, added a couple of features and updated it.
